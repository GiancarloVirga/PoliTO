\section{Application Structure}
Our application consist of an APK (Android Package) and is made up of a series of component: 
\itemize{
	\item	Activity
	\item	Service
	\item	Content Provider
	\item 	Broadcast Reciver
}
\subsection{Activity}
An single activity is related to a single task that a user can perform in the application. Activity can lauch other activity (nowadays almost all application have single activity)
\subsection{Service}
Services are used to request data from the internet. In modern android as soon our application isn't on the screen anymore, the services related to this app have a timeout and is forced to be closed or to be promoted to foreground service(publish an icon in the top bar, so the user can be aware of the service's execution)
An other special Service is the Background task execution, the schedule of this task is scheduled by the OS and is performed when CPU load is low.
\subsection{Content Provider}
The content Provider is used to provide to the application information coming form other applications (eg: select a photo that is stored in our phone in the instagramm app). 
\subsection{BroadcastReciver}
Collect system events and run code to provide solutions (for example if internet connection is low or memory is almost full)
